## Arrays

It is data structure of same elements. Elements can be integer, char, string, pair.

#### For java and C++

- If you define something out of main function that would come in the global scope.

- Inside main function you can define the arrays of size 10^6 but outside of main function till 10^7.

### Useful and important points
- Whenever something is there regarding the unique elements you should think of _mapping_ and _set_.

- Sometimes **hashing can't be the good choice for the large dataset** so for that you will have to use mapping, as well as **for negative integer operation because arrays don't have negative indexing.**

- In languages like C++ and Java use of ordered and unordered map matter in time complexity.


### Important questions

- Union of sorted array.
